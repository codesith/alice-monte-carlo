# alice-monte-carlo
A monte carlo simulation 

Alice has five coins in a bag: two coins are normal, two are double-headed, and the last one is double-tailed. She reaches into the bag and randomly pulls out a coin. Without looking at the coin she drew, she tosses it. The coin lands and shows heads face-up.
Alice immediately discards it, reaches again into the bag and draws out randomly a second coin. Again, without looking at it, she tosses it. What is the probability that the coin shows heads face-up?
